# TinDogs
Pet adoption app that has a user interface similar to popular dating apps.

Based on the popular dating Tinder, Tindogs is an app that connects adoption agencies and potential adopters. Adoption agencies and other organizations that house animals can create profiles for thier animals to be seen by others on the app. 

Details like age, physcial description, and status of health are included in this profile so that adoptees may understand what the animal is like. People looking to adopt also create profiles so that they may choose the animals that they are interested in. 

Those in charge of the animals accounts may also choose people that they think would be good matches. Based on lifestyle, location, and other other details that these individuals deem important, animals and adopters may be matched together. Now, times can be organized for the two parties to meet and see if this can be a forever home.

In these times more than ever, people are feelong isolated and alone. Numerous studies have shown the benefits that having a pet or being around them can have on a person, like study dogs for students during exam time, and its important that animals in shelters take priority over those in pets shops or mills. With our app, Tindogs hopes to bring theses two principles together by making it easier for people and animals in need to connect.
