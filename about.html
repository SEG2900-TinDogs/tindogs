        <p><strong>Why Tindogs Matters</strong></p>
        <p>
        Every year, hundreds of animals are left in shelters across the country. Every year, people are in search of furry, feathered and scaled companions. Tindogs is an app that brings these two sides together and makes the process of animal adoption a walk in the park.
       </p> 
       <br>
       <p> Born from the idea that no animal or human should have to be alone, Tindogs lets connections between people and shelter animals be formed, even from a distance.</p>
       <p> Shelters across the country can create profiles to show off thier pets, </p>
